*Change bias tee in directional coupler to the one minicirucits makes (TCBT-14+)
*Reset button appears to cause short that makes programming unreliable. Change to one with plastic housing.
*C79 and C80 should be changed to 100 pF
*Consider adding a buffer amp stage
*PLL Lock LED still doesn't turn on, even though the VCO appears to be working. Might be a bug (I think the chip errata lists it) or could be something else. The LED comes on in the dev board, so I don't know...

Move the SMA connector away from the ICSP pins on the back of the Arduino
