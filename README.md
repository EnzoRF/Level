## Level
#### A node for cognitive radio networks
---
Level is a small, low power and low bandwidth radio for creating and researching cognitive radio networks. It is still in a prototype phase. See the platform paper for a more detailed overview.

###Building
Firmware has been developed so far in Ti's Code Composer. If you prefer a free alternative, you can use [mspgcc](https://github.com/sergiocampama/Launchpad/blob/master/README.md). To save time, I've also been using SimpliciTI as a mesh networking stack. This isn't as free-as-in-speech as I'd like, and I plan on moving away from it. Until then, the license for that code is below.

###License
